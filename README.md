Hi, my name is Scott. I am a Computer Science major at the University of Washington, and I really enjoy solving the problems and challenging myself. Before going back to school, 
I was an automotive technician and a professional driver. I really enjoyed working on cars but felt that I wanted to challenge myself and decided to go back to school. This 
repository contains my personal projects that I created to challenge myself and showcase my skills.
